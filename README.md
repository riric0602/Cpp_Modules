# CPP Modules : *Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming*

> These modules were coded in C++98 (naturally), they are starting point of my C++ journey (and what an amazing journey that is).

The modules teach a lot about using C++ and leaving the C habits in order to benefit from the various utilities the C++ language provides.
Many things were learned whilst coding these modules such as implementing classes in **Canonical Form**, learning about **Heritage** and **Polymorphism**, **Abstract Classes** and **Interfaces**, **Template functions** and **classes**, and of course **STL Containers**.

The STL Containers are very diverse and each fits better in a scenario more than another, but of course learning the differences and the methods each one has was very informative.

In the last module, I had to implement the **Ford Johnson Algorithm** or better the **Merge-Insertion Algorithm**, and that was great research and a tedious assignment to achieve.
